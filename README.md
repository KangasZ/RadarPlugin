# 3D Radar Plugin
## Description
This plugin is an ESP. It's original goal was to simplify Deep Dungeons and Adventuring Forrays. Since then it has evolved into a customizable ESP that gives the user the tools to make their own experience.

This is a personal project so it is up to my own free time and willingness to support the plugin. 

However, please raise any issues with the current implementation or suggest features that you would like to see. I will take into account any suggestions in earnest.

A key goal with this plugin is customizability. While not everything is customizable, you can be very specific in what and how you see other mobs.

## Features
- 2D and 3D ESP for all entities in the game
- Custom Deep Dungeon and Adventuring Forray settings (Eureka)
- Full customization on a per-entity or per-entity class basis
- Full customization on a per-player basis
- Aggro Radius viewer - for use in Deep Dungeons with preconfigured aggro types
- Off-Screen object tracking
- Hitbox radius viewer
- Hot-swapping configs
- Tables to track previously made customizations and the current entities in memory

## Installation
